Minishell is a simple Unix shell implemented in C, designed as a project for 42 school. It provides basic shell functionalities similar to bash, including command execution, path handling, environment variable management, and built-in functions.

- **Command Execution**: Execute external commands with arguments.

- **Built-in Functions**:
- - `echo`: with support for the `-n` option.
- - `pwd`: print working directory.
- - `cd`: change directory.
- - `env`: display environment variables.
- - `export`: set an environment variable.

## Getting Started
To compile the minishell, simply run:
```bash
make
```
This will generate the minishell executable.

## Usage
To start the minishell, run:
```bash
./minishell
```
Once inside the minishell, you can use it just like a regular Unix shell, executing commands, using built-in functions, and managing environment variables.
